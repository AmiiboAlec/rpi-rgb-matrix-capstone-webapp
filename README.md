# rpi-rgb-matrix-capstone-webapp
A webapp image/gif viewer for RGB matrices, running on the raspberry pi


This is very much a work in progress. This was my capstone project at University and I had not organized it well. The backend and frontend were in entirely separate network drives even at the time. 
I am open to accepting contributions from others. I have tested on the Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W using the Adafruit RGB Matrix Bonnet with the PWM mod. 
I intend to add more modes of operation in the future!

#External Dependencies
